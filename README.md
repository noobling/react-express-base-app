# An example app to get you started with modern web technologies

> Building React apps is hard imo. Its even harder when you start from scratch. Honestly I haven't seen a single successful project using React and some JavaScript backend. There is so much potential here and using JavaScript everywhere is the future (imo). So I built this. Its not quite there yet and it may never get finished but there are a few common features you can use to learn from ðŸ˜‡

## Getting started

Make sure you have

- `VSCode`
- `Node`
- `Yarn`
- `Prettier and eslint` plugins with linting and formatting set to on save in VSCode
- .env for both frontend and backend set (ask me if you don't know how to)
- `git`

1. `git clone` the repo
2. `cd` into frontend and do yarn install
3. make sure you have the `.env` set and start the server with yarn start
4. `cd` into the backend and do a `yarn install`
5. migrate the database with `yarn migrate`
6. start the server with `yarn dev`

> should be obvious if things didn't work

## BIG TODO LIST

Stuffs not yet done software takes a long time, built by dozens of highly trained engineers.

- [ ] Linting and formatting for backend
- [ ] Add standard services such as emails, Google Maps, Scheduled jobs, Sentry
- [ ] Cypress e2e tests
- [ ] jest frontend tests
- [ ] configure prisma.schema db sources better

## Services used

- Auth0
- Pusher
